# Transactions

Transactions in Nimiq are used to move funds from a given address' account to a another address' account. They are part of the body of each Block that gets stored in the Blockchain.

There are three transaction types:
  * [Basic](#basic-transaction-type)
  * [Extended](#extended-transaction-type)
  * [Legacy](#legacy-transaction-type)

## Basic transaction type

The basic transaction type is composed of 6 fields:

  * The sender's public key
  * The recipient's address
  * The value been transferred
  * The fee to be paid to the miner for including the transaction in a block
  * A nonce to protect from replay attacks
  * The signature generated by the sender's private key

## Extended transaction type

The extended transaction type (as it name implies) allows more fields to be included (but also has some other small differences):

  * Instead of the sender's public key, they include the sender's address
  * The sender's account type
  * The recipient's address
  * The recipient's account type
  * The value been transferred
  * The fee to be paid to the miner for including the transaction in a block
  * A nonce to protect from replay attacks
  * A data field
  * A proof field (that includes the sender's public key along with the signature generated by the user's private key)

## Legacy transaction type

The Legacy transaction type is very similar to the basic transaction type, but it's deprecated and shouldn't be used anymore.
